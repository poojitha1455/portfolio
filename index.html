        <p>
I'm Poojitha, currently pursuing my final year of B.Tech at MallaReddy University of Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in the Internet of Things (IoT). I have a solid foundation in full-stack development, which includes front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, as well as back-end development with Java.

During my academic journey, I have worked on several projects, including a Java-based application called "Card Connect," which focuses on leveraging smart card scanning to retrieve and manage business information efficiently. I am passionate about building innovative and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

Besides coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my problem-solving skills, and collaborating with teams to create impactful software solutions. I am excited to further enhance my expertise and contribute to meaningful projects in the software development field.

        <h2> Project:Card connect</h2>
        <p>In the card connect project by scanning the card we can able to gather the information regarding anything like shops and other.In the Card Connect project, by scanning a smart card—such as an RFID or QR-enabled card—we can seamlessly gather detailed information about a range of entities, including shops, services, and other relevant data. The system reads the unique card ID and queries a cloud database to instantly retrieve associated business details (like store name, location, contact info, and offers).

It also supports dynamic updates: when a user visits a new location or interacts with a new vendor, the card scanning fetches real-time information—such as current promotions or available inventory—enhancing the user experience.

Moreover, integrating analytics enables tracking card usage patterns: which shops are visited, how frequently, and the time spent at each location. This valuable insight can be used to personalize recommendations and offers for the user.

Future enhancements could include adding loyalty program integration, offline caching of essential data, and multi-tier authentication to verify user identity securely before accessing sensitive information.</p>
